# Sigma-Calculator
This is where ill post my sigma calculator 

It is gonna be a low bugdet calculator that can do specific operations and call out brain rot numbers you input etc etc

For example: If you write 30+37, instead of 67 it will say "BOIII TS TO TUFF"

etc etc. currently im only planning for the 6-7 meme
